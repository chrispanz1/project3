# H1 This is my project called music directory! This project allows its users to keep track of music they enjoy!

## Ive utilized react, mongo database, axios to complete this project Ive created routes and authentication to move data throughout the code.
### My favorite component is the musicque component because it displays the song information for the user!
### In terms of wire framing my project is very simple, I tried to make everything look obvious on the page without to much clutter!
